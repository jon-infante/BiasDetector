# **Spring Intensive Proposal**

ates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Jon Infante**

**Project Name: Bias Detector**

**Is your project New or Old? New**

**Is your project Solo or Team? Solo**

## **Description**

With all the elections that are going on now it is important to know where people's opinions overtake the actual facts. Knowing the difference between the two is imperative when deciding what candidate to select. This web app is going to show bias in a specific article or amount of text. I want to be able for people to upload or copy text to the site and show how much bias is within it. Another challenge is to learn to navigate Watson's API and generate a machine learning model during this intensive. 

## **Challenges I Anticipate**

- Learning to use the Watson API and manage data-related assets
- Use Natural Language Understanding to generate a ML model
- Making the front end look appealing

## **Skateboard**

Build Backend and have front end set up to show information about specific biases.

## **Bike**

Use Watson's API to extract and clean data and show what articles contain bias.

## **Car**

Have a ML model to take s text and return what accuracy it predicts that the text is biased or not.

## **Personal Achievement Goals:**

### Jon Infante

1. Set up the front and back end of the web app.
2. Retrieve information from IBM Watson's Cloud datasets
3. Train a ML model to return bias predictions
