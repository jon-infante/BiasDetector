# Bias Detector
> Determines bias from an article or body of text.


[![Build Status][travis-image]

With all the elections that are going on now it is important to know where people's opinions overtake the actual facts. Knowing the difference between the two is imperative when deciding what candidate to select. This web app is going to show bias in a specific article or amount of text. I want to be able for people to upload or copy text to the site and show how much bias is within it. 

Using NLP Machine Learning, the app determines if the text has a left or right leaning political bias.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```$ git clone https://github.com/jon-infante/BiasDetector.git```

## Usage example

Say someone wants to participate in an upcoming election but doesn't have enough understanding of all the news outlets, using this app will help get viewpoints from both sides.


## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.


```$ pip freeze > requirements.txt```<br/>
```$ flask run```
